# CRAYON.CODE — Jesse Kidula's Developer Portfolio

A modern developer portfolio inspired by the imperfect beauty of crayons—soft edges, hand-drawn strokes, and layered colors—combined with senior engineering discipline.

##  Design Concept
The site embodies "A child’s curiosity meets a senior engineer’s precision." It uses muted crayon hues, hand-sketched accents, and organic textures to create a unique, human-centric technical portfolio.
