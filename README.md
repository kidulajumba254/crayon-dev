# CRAYON.CODE — Jesse Kidula's Developer Portfolio

A modern developer portfolio inspired by the imperfect beauty of crayons—soft edges, hand-drawn strokes, and layered colors—combined with senior engineering discipline.

##  Design Concept
The site embodies "A child’s curiosity meets a senior engineer’s precision." It uses muted crayon hues, hand-sketched accents, and organic textures to create a unique, human-centric technical portfolio.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React (19.x)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API (for dynamic artwork)

##  Core Features
- **Crayon-Inspired UI**: Hand-drawn borders, wax-shading hover effects, and animated crayon strokes.
- **Dynamic Cursor Trail**: Leaves subtle color splashes as the user explores the interface.
- **Interactive Project Showcase**: Tilt effects and detailed case study modals.
- **AI Magic Sketchbook**: Integration with Gemini for real-time crayon-style art generation.
- **Responsive Navigation**: Seamless experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Handwritten Testimonials**: Sticky-note style slider for professional feedback.
